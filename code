		"description": "Artificial friendship is a nightmare in the trailer for the new horror movie M3gan. The new film stars Allison Williams as Gemma, a roboticist who works at a toy company. When she takes in her niece, whose parents recently died, she's at a loss for how to help her through her grief. So she introduces her to her company's newest creation, a robot toy named M3gan, intended to be the perfect friend. But M3gan isn't remotely close to a dream come true. In the haunting trailer, released Oct. 11, M3GAN's antics are soundtracked with a spooky version of Taylor Swift's It's Nice to Have a Friend." In this horror film, it's anything but. M3gan is directed by Gerard Johnstone from a screenplay by Akela Cooper. It's produced by horror powerhouses James Wan and Jason Blum.

                               M3gan puts a technological twist on the classic horror movie trope of possessed dolls. Some of the most iconic include the Chucky doll from Child's Play, Annabelle, The Boy, and Dolls. M3gan, with her big creepy eyes, also shares a passing resemblance to the creepy Renesmee doll created for the Twilight movies.",
